          on the experience they had while funded by Omidyar Network’s GCE initiative
          and the recommendations have been developed according to experiences with
          Omidyar Network’s processes and dynamics (rather than Luminate’s). These
          learnings can therefore be seen as a useful baseline for Luminate to evaluate
          itself against going forward.

            HCD methods are applicable in any part of a product or service development process, from initial needfinding through prototyping and feedback. The On Trust & Transparency project was early-stage, formative work focused on surfacing the needs of investees. This work could potentially be continued in the future to further develop the recommendations.

          e.g., interviews, design workshops and exercises, and participatory methods.
          These techniques surface participants’ priorities and values by giving them
          control over the focus of the research. Each interaction is a unique response
          to each participant, tailored to their individual concerns. HCD methods
          aren’t entirely open-ended; a common overall structure allows researchers
          to draw out parallel themes and insights.

          In contrast to a top-down process which emphasizes the priorities of a funder,
          human-centered research as applied to philanthropy offers the opportunity

          questions and clear topics to cover, but remained flexible enough for the
          participant to direct time and attention to their—rather than Simply Secure’s—priorities.
          New questions that took shape during the interviews were then used to shape
          a survey. The survey contained more targeted questions, and was distributed
