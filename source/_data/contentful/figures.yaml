    Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating where this project's work falls within the overall human-centered design (HCD) process.

    HCD methods are applicable in any part of a product or service development process, from initial needfinding through prototyping and feedback. The On Trust & Transparency project was early-stage, formative work focused on surfacing the needs of investees. This work could potentially be continued in the future to further develop the recommendations.
