  insight_title: Grantees value deep and trusting relationships with funders, grounded
    in subject area expertise.
  short_description: 'A strong relationship between the funder and grantee builds
    trust, enabling the grantee to take more initiative and negotiate for their needs.
    Partnering with an investment lead (IL) or program officer with subject area expertise
    is especially critical for grantees to feel like their work is understood. '

  long_description: "The investment lead (IL) was seen by participants as the face
    of GCE for grantees.* A positive experience with an IL reflects very well on the
    organization as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly
    valued.\n\nThe ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel
    understood and heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with
    GCE as a team. One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional,
    constructive, and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.”
    \n\nOrganizations who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly positive
    about their IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention they received.
    “They’ve truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators in our work
    as they do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s openness
    to collaboration and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive for those
    who had taken the initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who were confident
    enough to push back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting — felt respected
    and heard, and often got what they asked for. Having pushed back didn’t seem to
    hurt their reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything, it seemed to lead
    to greater mutual respect.\n\n*Investment Lead (IL) is a similar role to a Program
    Officer at a foundation."

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_title: Grantees crave structure and clarity with regards to 1) the funding
    process and what to expect from the relationship once funded, and 2) shifting
    strategic priorities.
  short_description: Structured funding processes, clear communication about strategic
    priorities, and how to secure funding are critical. Without this, potential grantees
    have inconsistent experiences and misunderstandings can arise.

    quote: "“I don’t really understand how decisions are made.”"
  long_description: "When we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
    all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not likely
    to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure in the
    IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere on the spectrum
    between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions – and “hands-off”
    – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both extremes have advantages
    and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions” was associated with a
    lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even favoritism.\n\nIn more hands-on
    relationships, organizations felt they had received bespoke engagement from GCE,
    often describing their ILs as mentors and partners. This makes them feel unique
    and valued, and allows organizations to ask for help when they need it.\n\nHowever,
    some participants told us that a hands-on approach isn’t always better. The downside
    of a personalized, high-touch experience is that grantees struggled to explain
    how GCE made decisions. When asked about the main factors in GCE’s funding decision,
    many interviewees said they could not generalize because “[their] case was an
    outlier.” \n\nOn the other hand, a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily
    mean that all organizations receive the same treatment. While some organizations
    praised the efficiency of a standardized funding process and stated that they
    have more trust in a standardized process, many organizations with a “low-touch”
    relationship with GCE felt that their needs were not being met. They were more
    likely to see other grantees as competitors for GCE’s attention.\n\n\n### Structure
    & Clarity: The Funding Process\n\nMany participants said they were uncertain about
    what to expect before and during the process. For example, some interviewees expressed
    bewilderment about the role of the investment committee.* This confusion translated
    into insecurity about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel
    might not be appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered
    about how much information they should share with their IL, especially information
    that might make their organization look bad, and how much of that would then be
    shared with the investment committee, who they would likely not have met for the
    first time until the end of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration
    with burdensome processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people
    from GCE. Over two-thirds of interviewees bemoaned a process that was long, difficult,
    and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.” \n\nThey reported being asked
    to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information, sending
    the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some participants
    mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment process particularly
    stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would receive a final decision
    from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n### Structure & Clarity:
    Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees repeatedly mentioned that the value of their relationship
    with GCE was more than financial. While part of the GCE portfolio or network (as
    grantees referred to it), they were able to take advantage of the GCE/ON stamp
    of approval, enjoy publicity and attention through their connection with GCE/ON,
    and reap the benefits of a personal relationship with their IL (often a powerful
    player in their field). \n\nSince the personal relationship with the IL is a signature
    component of being part of the network, being transitioned out of the portfolio
    can feel like a personal betrayal. Some participants, that have received longer-term
    support from GCE, felt that new projects were competitors not just for money but also
    for attention. Concerns were raised based on what they knew of other organization’s
    experiences, and fears over the stability of their own funding.\n\nThis feeling
    of personal betrayal also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees
    working in the space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. Some
    participants noted that when GCE pivoted to a different investment strategy, focusing
    on new and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issue areas felt rejected.
    It is not only a financial, but also an emotional matter to lose the support of
    GCE, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent power imbalances in the funder-grantee
    relationship.\n\n*The investment committee is the approval committee for grants
    and investments."

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

    working in complex and changing circumstances is essential to their success.

    GCE committing to investing in their organizations, helping them expand beyond
    their current spheres of influence, building and strengthening organizational
    capacity, and becoming lasting, sustainable contributors to the field. \n\nWe
    heard many examples of organizations scrambling to meet the additional requirements
    of other funders for detailed project-based proposals  while trying to “keep the
    lights on” in their day-to-day operations. \n\nHowever, participants who received
    core funding reflected on the value of such holistic support in helping strengthen
    organizational health. This stood out in the non-profit sector as a highly valuable
    contribution that is much appreciated. "

      they have questions, but we never get feedback.”"
  long_description: "### Reporting Processes\n\nIn the best case, quarterly and annual
    reports serve as much more than just an update or checkup. Reporting can be an
    integral part of creating a common understanding of the organization’s goals and
    core mission. Some participants stated that creating reports helped them hone
    their organizational focus. \n\nBut in other cases, reporting was seen as busy
    work that takes time away from what organizations saw as their “real work.” These
    participants viewed the report as a deliverable external to their organizational
    goals. This group also expressed doubts about the utility of their reports to
    GCE, since they rarely heard feedback after submitting reports. \n\nAmong the
    people who were the most satisfied with reports, many of them had negotiated a
    reporting format that worked for them. For example, some organizations sent one
    standardized report to all of their funders, so they didn’t have to spend time
    preparing multiple reports. Others worked with GCE to develop a specific format
    that best fit both their needs and GCE’s. We noticed that the organizations who
    took the initiative to make reporting work well for them were more likely to see
    the real outcome as not the report itself, but as a benefit to their organization’s
    health. On average, organizations reported that narrative reports are more cumbersome
    to produce than financial reports, but almost all respondents felt narrative reports
    were a clearer reflection of the organization. \n\n\n### Metrics & Benchmarks\n\nWhen
    we explored the topic of reporting with interviewees, the conversation often turned
    to the metrics that are, for organizations, tightly linked with reporting.\n\nMost
    organizations had experience with impact measurement of some kind, though sometimes
    at a less rigorous level than GCE’s standards. As with reporting formats, participants
    who pushed back on initial metrics, and as a result collaborated to create metrics
    they found more meaningful and useful, were the most satisfied and positive about
    their metrics. The chance to create impact metrics together with GCE was described
    as a helpful learning experience. In particular, some participants noted the value
    of being exposed to learning measurement techniques associated with the commercial
    sector. \n\nThe negative comments about metrics came from participants who felt
    that metrics were handed to them without opportunities for discussion and revision,
    and thus were neither reasonable nor applicable to their strategy and impact model.
    One participant noted that they were “burdened with measurable but unfair metrics
    and expectations.” Another commented that meeting metrics would only be possible
    if they behaved unethically. These organizations generally saw metrics as a way
    to quantitatively describe outputs, rather than a way to monitor outcomes. "

  insight_short: Portfolio Support
  insight_title: Grantees are interested in and looking for portfolio support, and
    would like more clarity, autonomy, and choice in how they access and receive that
    support.
  short_description: Grantees have many organizational health needs that can be met
    by connecting them with the right resources, such as other organizations, consultants,
    services, mentors or vendors. However, it is important that the process for accessing
    this support and the context in which it is provided is clear, to avoid it being
    seen as punitive.

  long_description: "Participants expressed interest in the following portfolio support*
    areas:\n\n- Recruiting and hiring: Growth and scaling were important concerns
    for many of the respondents, and in some cases “growth” was understood to mean hiring people
    to help meet metrics. Grantees see a need for active recruiting and hiring support.\n-
    Financial management: Both survey respondents and interview participants strongly
    agreed that GCE had expertise in financial management.\n- Fundraising: 88% of
    survey respondents indicated that fundraising support was extremely desirable.\n-
    Networking, outreach and community development: Interview participants appreciated
    the sense of belonging that came from attending GCE gatherings and viewed access
    to other grantees as valuable. They also appreciated when GCE helped to expand
    their reach, e.g., on social media by “signal boosting” or promoting their work.\n-
    Evaluation and audits: Organizations that have undergone an evaluation or audit
    generally reported positive experiences.\n\nKnowing that this kind of additional
    support existed wasn’t enough for organizations to feel that GCE was meeting their
    specific needs, because there was no framework for taking advantage of the offers.
    \ \n\nSome participants expressed concerns about accepting alternative portfolio
    support from GCE, due to the power difference inherent in the funding relationship
    and the implications of admitting weakness to a funder. Their concerns ranged
    from not being able to pick or change who the service provider is to wondering
    if the service provider would “spy” on them and report weaknesses to GCE. \n\nThese
    concerns were tied to participants not having clarity about why support was being
    offered and to what end – was it because GCE was keen to help proactively build
    organizational capacity, or was it because they were performing badly and GCE
    was intervening? This concern may indicate a lack of underlying trust; some participants
    indicated that they could not be sure that GCE had their best interests in mind,
    and therefore were hesitant to share challenges or accept support.\n\nIn the past,
    GCE ILs have provided portfolio support by taking seats on select grantees’ boards.
    This is a unique practice in the non-profit funding sector, and was generally
    met with skepticism. Over one-third of survey respondents believed that the practice
    of GCE holding board seats was not at all helpful for their organization. Their
    reasons included fear of sharing internal problems with a funder present, power
    or knowledge asymmetry, negative perceptions by third parties of having a funder
    on the board, and concerns that representing GCE’s interests would take priority
    over acting in the grantee’s best interest. There was a qualitative difference
    in the sentiments of those observing the practice of GCE taking board seats and
    those experiencing it. Survey respondents who had a member of GCE staff on their
    board, viewed this participation more positively than those respondents who didn’t.
    \n\nThere was a positive correlation between GCE’s participation on an organization’s
    board and that organization’s perception of the ease of communication with GCE.
    \ Leaders of organizations with a board member or observer felt much more comfortable
    asking for help, implying a closer relationship and more open channels of communication.\n\nWhat
    most organizations appreciated from board members was strategic advice, operational
    support, and connections to the ecosystem.\n\n*Portfolio support refers to specifically
    earmarked support, above and beyond grant funding, to build organizational capacity
    and resilience. Examples include executive coaching, fundraising support, digital
    security trainings, or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reviews."

    recommendation: Give grantees more autonomy and choice when taking advantage of
      additional __portfolio support__ e.g., by giving them ownership over who to
      work with and under what terms. Have clear guidelines around privacy and NDAs
      with the vendors.

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_short: Power Dynamics
  insight_title: Power dynamics, if not acknowledged, can affect the strength and
    quality of funder-grantee relationships.
  short_description: There are inherent power dynamics at play in funding relationships,
    with funders holding a lot power and influence over grantees. Funders that acknowledge
    and, as far as possible, work to address these dynamics, create stronger and more
    successful relationships with their grantees.

    quote: "“What they think is a friendly request can come across as a mandate.”"
  long_description: "As with all funding relationships, GCE held the power in the
    funder-grantee relationship. But being aware and conscious of the effects of that
    power dynamic is an area where GCE could have done better, according to grantees:
    “in theory the money is open, but [GCE is] the least aware of the power and influence
    they have over their partners,” said one participant. The problems we heard stemming
    from this lack of awareness about power dynamics mainly fell into two categories.\n\nFirst,
    participants mentioned to us that, when people who represented GCE made a request,
    they did not always feel able to respond with anything other than “yes,” fearing
    that seeming uncooperative might have a negative effect on their funding. This
    held true even when the request was presented as friendly or optional, or as personal
    rather than coming from GCE. Even people who feel confident about pushing back
    on topics directly related to their funding, like metrics, weren’t always willing
    to take the risk of pushing back on requests that seemed to be more personal or
    casual. \n\nSecond, we also heard from participants who felt that GCE had sometimes
    overstepped by contacting their networks. Speaking to people related to a particular
    organization is often a standard part of a funder’s due diligence process. When
    participants became aware of this due diligence after the fact, they often expressed
    feeling embarrassed and ashamed that their networks were contacted without their
    knowledge. These situations caused participants to worry that GCE had harmed their
    social capital by potentially presenting their organization in an unflattering
    or what they considered inaccurate light. \n\nWe heard from grantees that they
    often do not feel comfortable being honest about their areas of weakness in conversation
    with their ILs. When grantees conceal their weaknesses, it is sometimes motivated
    by the power differential at play. But it can also be motivated by respect and
    admiration. An individual who wants to be seen as successful and a strong asset
    to an organization they admire (e.g., Luminate) is not as likely to speak openly
    about problems. "

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_title: A funder’s reputation impacts the funder-grantee relationship.
  short_description: In addition to providing an organization needed resources, a
    funding relationship establishes a public connection between the grantee and the
    funder, which can provide meaningful validation or, in some cases, bring up reputational
    challenges for grantees.

    quote: "“Their stamp of approval means a lot.”"
  long_description: |-
    In regions where Omidyar Network (ON) is established, receiving funding can mark an organization as stable, competent, professional, and committed to measurable impact. In regions where ON is less established, the funding can label an organization as either a rising star or as one of the top players in the field. The ON stamp of approval has the potential to make organizations much more attractive to other funders. Participants were aware that other funding decisions appear to be and can be influenced by receiving ON funding. As this research was conducted prior to the launch of Luminate’s brand, it is important to note that the brand and reputation that is spoken of is tied strongly to the name “Omidyar” (ON).

    In contrast, many participants expressed concerns that the optics of their organization publically accepting support from a “Silicon Valley” funder could be a liability, particularly in contexts hostile to capitalism or corporate donors (e.g., social projects that are critical of free-market liberalism, or media projects critical of big tech). These concerns have been heightened due to global tensions around philanthropy, influence and power.

  insight_title: A lack of transparency around how diversity, equity and inclusion
    (DEI) is valued and integrated into a funder’s work can lead to questions about
    a funder’s commitment to DEI.
  short_description: Funders need to be transparent about how diversity, equity and
    inclusion (DEI) are valued and integrated internally in order to authentically
    engage grantees on these issues. Not doing so can lead organizations to question
    the funder’s commitment to DEI, and the extent to which DEI informs organizational
    culture and plays into both funding and internal processes.

  long_description: "Interviewees mentioned in multiple contexts that GCE did not
    appear to them to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Organizations
    questioned whether and how DEI played into the funding process and GCE’s internal
    practices. \n\nParticipants would welcome a more direct and transparent approach
    to the values of DEI at Luminate. Participants sometimes ascribed frustration
    with systemic discrimination problems happening in Silicon Valley onto GCE as
    well, due to their perception that GCE’s approach was aligned with more negative
    aspects of Silicon Valley’s culture. Some participants even spoke about not bringing
    up DEI-related issues with GCE, saying that they didn’t think GCE would be able
    to help or even understand. For these participants, their perception of GCE was
    of an organization that was heteronormative, white, and male.\n\nSeveral participants
    also found it noteworthy that there was no diversity data on the Omidyar Network
    / GCE website. They also remarked on the fact that the team did not ask for any
    diversity data during the investment process.\n\nParticipants were generally aware
    that GCE used DEI considerations in their assessment of an organization, but it
    seems that not all ILs involved grantees in the collection or reporting of that
    information about the organization.\n\n__NOTES:__ \n\nTransparency is key to fostering
    an equitable playing field amongst grantees. Transparency ensures that information
    about funding processes and support are made clear to all, rather than offered
    through informal channels only to grantees in a position to initiate a discussion
    or inquiry. \n"

  insight_short: Funder Roles
  insight_title: When funders wear multiple hats — as individual advocates as well
    as representatives of a funding organization — it can be unclear which role the
    funder is playing at any given time.
  short_description: The power dynamic of the funder-grantee relationship is always
    present, even when the individuals from organizations are interacting in other
    contexts. If funders are also going to be active in the spaces where their grantees
    work, then they need to clearly communicate which role they are in, so as not
    to unintentionally overstep or blur the funder-grantee relationship.

    quote: "“You can’t participate in civil society if you are a funder. You never
      get more than 50% of what is going on.”"
  long_description: "The confusion was exacerbated by the fact that GCE saw itself
    as an “operational funder” (and still does as Luminate). This can be broadly defined
    as a funding organization that engages in direct advocacy as well as also supporting
    the policy and advocacy goals of organizations in the field.\n\nChallenges arose
    when members of GCE’s staff were seen to be wearing multiple hats – as individual
    advocates as well as representatives of a funding organization. When individual
    staff express support for something, people hearing it are not always able to
    determine if the statement of support means 1) this is interesting work that someone
    should be doing that aligns with GCE’s priorities, 2) this is a priority for a
    direct operational play by GCE, or 3) this is critical to the social-political
    moment in general. \n\nSome participants voiced concerns about funders also acting
    as advocates, as funders naturally have a position of power in the space and have
    access to knowledge not available to other advocates. Others pointed out that
    GCE’s success depended on its staff taking the time to develop very clear opinions
    and stances on particular issues, which naturally leads to a more “activist” position."

    page_title: Be Explicit About Roles
    recommendation: Be explicit about __which role you are playing at a given time
      (as both a funder and advocate in the field)__, understand where the boundaries
      of that role lie, and be aware of the conflict that may crop up when switching
      roles. This is relevant both in private (e.g., in a conversation with a prospective
      grantee) and in public (e.g., when writing a white paper).
