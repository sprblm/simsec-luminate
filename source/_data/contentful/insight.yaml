  insight_title: Grantees value deep and trusting relationships with funders, grounded
    in subject area expertise.
  short_description: A strong relationship between the funder and grantee builds trust,
    enabling the grantee to take more initiative and negotiate for their needs. Partnering
    with an investment lead (IL) or program officer with subject area expertise is
    especially critical for grantees to feel like their work is understood.

  long_description: "The investment lead (IL) or program officer is the face of Luminate
    for grantees. A positive experience with an IL reflects very well on the organization
    as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly valued.\n\nThe
    ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel understood and
    heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with GCE as a team.
    One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional, constructive,
    and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.” \n\nOrganizations
    who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly positive about their
    IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention they received. “They’ve
    truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators in our work as they
    do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s openness to collaboration
    and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive for those who had taken the
    initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who were confident enough to push
    back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting — felt respected and heard,
    and often got what they asked for. Having pushed back didn’t seem to hurt their
    reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything, it seemed to lead to greater
    mutual respect."

    process, 2) what to expect from the relationship once funded, and 3) shifting
    strategic priorities.
  short_description: Structured funding processes, and clear communication about a
    funder’s strategic priorities and how to secure funding, are critical. Without
    this, potential grantees have inconsistent experiences and misunderstandings can
    arise.

    quote: "“I don’t really understand how decisions are made.”"
  long_description: "\nWhen we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
    all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not likely
    to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure in the
    IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere on the spectrum
    between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions – and “hands-off”
    – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both extremes have advantages
    and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions” can be associated with
    a lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even nepotism.\n\nIn more hands-on
    relationships, organizations felt they had received bespoke engagement from GCE,
    often describing their ILs as mentors and partners. This makes them feel unique
    and valued, and allows organizations to ask for help when they need it.\n\nHowever,
    some participants told us that a hands-on approach isn’t always better. The downside
    of a personalized, high-touch experience is that grantees struggled to explain
    how GCE made decisions. When asked about the main factors in GCE’s funding decision,
    many interviewees said they could not generalize because “[their] case was an
    outlier”. \n\nOn the other hand, a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily
    mean that all organizations receive the same treatment. While some organizations
    praised the efficiency of a standardized funding process and stated that they
    have more trust in a standardized process, many organizations with a “low-touch”
    relationship with GCE felt that their needs were not being met. They were more
    likely to see other grantees as competitors for GCE’s attention.\n\n## The Funding
    Process\n\nMany participants said they were uncertain about what to expect before
    and during the process. For example, some interviewees expressed bewilderment
    about the role of the investment committee. This confusion translated into insecurity
    about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel might not be
    appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered about how much
    information they should share with their IL, especially information that might
    make their organization look bad, and how much of that will then be shared with
    the investment committee, who they may not meet for the first time until the end
    of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration with burdensome
    processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people from GCE. Over
    two-thirds of non-profit interviewees bemoaned a process that was long, difficult,
    and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.”\n\nThey reported being asked
    to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information, sending
    the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some participants
    mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment process particularly
    stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would receive a final decision
    from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n## Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees
    repeatedly mentioned that the value of their relationship with Luminate is more
    than financial. While they’re part of the Luminate portfolio or network (as grantees
    referred to it), they take advantage of the Luminate stamp of approval, enjoy
    publicity and attention through their connection with Luminate, and reap the benefits
    of a personal relationship with their IL, who is often a powerful player in their
    field.\n\nSince the personal relationship with the IL is a signature component
    of being part of the Luminate network, being transitioned out of the portfolio
    can feel like a personal betrayal. When their relationship with Luminate ends,
    some organizations that have received longer-term support from Luminate feel that
    new projects are competitors, not just for money, but also for attention. Participants
    raised these concerns based on what they know of other organizations’ experiences,
    and fears they have about the the stability of their funding.\n\nThis feeling
    of personal betrayal also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees
    working in the space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. When
    GCE/Luminate pivots to a different investment strategy, such as focusing on new
    and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issues feel a rejection of the
    issues they personally care about. It is not only a financial, but also an emotional
    matter, to lose the support of Luminate, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent
    power imbalances in the funder-grantee relationship."

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_title: Multi-year flexible funding is extremely valued.
  short_description: Core funding, i.e., non-earmarked, general operating support,
    can be difficult to secure from foundations, but the flexibility it gives to organizations
    working in complex and changing circumstances is essential to their success.

    quote: "“They care about sustainability – explore and strengthen your funding
      structure, don’t be as dependent on grants.”"
  long_description: "Grantees receiving core funding expressed that they felt it represented
    GCE committing to investing in their organizations, helping them expand beyond
    their current spheres of influence, building and strengthening organizational
    capacity, and becoming lasting, sustainable contributors to the field. \n\nWe
    heard many examples of organizations reported scrambling to meet the additional
    requirements of detailed project-based proposals while trying to “keep the lights
    on” in their day-to-day operations. \n\nHowever, participants who received core
    funding reflected on the value of such holistic support in helping strengthen
    organizational health. This stood out in the non-profit sector as a highly valuable
    contribution that is much appreciated. \n"

  long_description: "### Reporting Processes\n\nIn the best case, quarterly and annual
    reports serve as much more than just an update or checkup. Reporting can be an
    integral part of creating a common understanding of the organization’s goals and
    core mission. Some participants stated that creating reports helped them hone
    their organizational focus.\n\nBut in other cases, reporting was seen as busy
    work that takes time away from what organizations saw as their “real work.” These
    participants viewed the report as a deliverable external to their organizational
    goals. This group also expressed doubts about the utility of their reports to
    GCE, since they rarely heard feedback after submitting reports.\n\nAmong the people
    who were the most satisfied with reports, many of them had negotiated a reporting
    format that worked for them. For example, some organizations sent one standardized
    report to all of their funders, so they didn’t have to spend time preparing multiple
    reports. Others worked with GCE to develop a specific format that best fit both
    their needs and GCE’s. We noticed that the organizations who took the initiative
    to make reporting work well for them were more likely to see the real outcome
    as not the report itself, but as a benefit to their organization’s health. On
    average, organizations reported that narrative reports are more cumbersome to
    produce than financial reports, but almost all respondents felt narrative reports
    were a clearer reflection of the organization. \n\n### Metrics & Benchmarks\n\nWhen
    we explored the topic of reporting with interviewees, the conversation often turned
    to the metrics that are, for organizations, tightly linked with reporting.\n\nMost
    organizations had experience with impact measurement of some kind, though sometimes
    at a less rigorous level than GCE's standards. As with reporting formats, participants
    who pushed back on initial metrics, and as a result collaborated to create metrics
    they found more meaningful and useful, were the most satisfied and positive about
    their metrics. The chance to create impact metrics together with GCE was described
    as a helpful learning experience. In particular, some participants noted the value
    of being exposed to learning measurement techniques associated with the commercial
    sector.\n\nThe negative comments about metrics came from participants who felt
    that metrics were handed to them without opportunities for discussion and revision,
    and thus were neither reasonable nor applicable to their strategy and impact model.
    One participant noted that they were “burdened with measurable but unfair metrics
    and expectations.” Another commented that meeting metrics would only be possible
    if they behaved unethically. These organizations generally saw metrics as a way
    to quantitatively describe outputs, rather than a way to monitor outcomes.\n\n"

  insight_title: Grantees are interested in, and looking for portfolio support, and
    would like more clarity, autonomy, and choice in how they access and receive that
    support.
  short_description: Grantees have many organizational health needs that can be met
    by connecting them with the right resources, such as other organizations, consultants,
    services, mentors or vendors. However, it is important that the process for accessing
    this support and the context in which it is provided is clear, to avoid it being
    seen as punitive.

    Participants expressed interest in the following support areas:

    - Recruiting and hiring: Growth and scaling are important concerns for many of our respondents, and in some cases “growth” is understood to mean hiring people to help meet metrics. Non-profit organizations see a need for active recruiting and hiring support.
    - Financial management: Both survey respondents and interview participants strongly agreed that GCE had expertise in financial management.
    - Fundraising: 88% of survey respondents indicated that fundraising support was extremely desirable.
    - Networking, outreach and community development: Interview participants appreciated the sense of belonging that came from attending GCE gatherings and viewed access to other grantees as valuable. They also appreciated when GCE helped to expand their reach, e.g., on social media by "signal boosting" or promoting their work.
    - Evaluation and audits: Organizations that have undergone an evaluation or audit generally reported positive experiences.

    Knowing that this kind of additional support existed wasn’t enough for organizations to feel that GCE was meeting their specific needs, because there was no framework for taking advantage of the offers.

    Some participants expressed concerns about accepting alternative portfolio support from GCE, due to the power difference inherent in the funding relationship and the implications of admitting weakness to a funder. Their concerns ranged from not being able to pick or change who the service provider is to wondering if the service provider would “spy” on them and report weaknesses to GCE.

    These concerns were tied to participants not having clarity about why support was being offered and to what end – was it because GCE was keen to help proactively build organizational capacity, or was it because they were performing badly and GCE was intervening? This concern may indicate a lack of underlying trust; some participants indicated that they could not be sure that GCE had their best interests in mind, and therefore were hesitant to share challenges or accept support.

    In the past, GCE ILs have provided portfolio support by taking seats on select grantees' boards. This is a unique practice in the non-profit funding sector, and was generally met with skepticism. Over one-third of survey respondents believed that the practice of GCE holding board seats was not at all helpful for their organization. Their reasons included fear of sharing internal problems with a funder present, power or knowledge asymmetry, negative perceptions by third parties of having a funder on the board, and concerns that representing GCE’s interests would take priority over acting in the grantee’s best interest. There was a qualitative difference in the sentiments of those observing the practice of GCE taking board seats and those experiencing it. Survey respondents who had a member of GCE staff on their board, viewed this participation more positively than those respondents who didn't.

    There was a positive correlation between GCE's participation on an organization's board and that organization's perception of the ease of communication with GCE. Leaders of organizations with a board member or observer felt much more comfortable asking for help, implying a closer relationship and more open channels of communication.

    What most organizations appreciated from board members was strategic advice, operational support, and connections to the ecosystem.

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_title: Power dynamics, if not acknowledged, can affect the strength and
    quality of funder-grantee relationships.
  short_description: There are inherent power dynamics at play in funding relationships,
    with funders holding a lot power and influence over grantees. Funders that acknowledge
    and, as far as possible, work to address these dynamics, create stronger and more
    successful relationships with their grantees.

    quote: "“What they think is a friendly request can come across as a mandate.”"
  long_description: |-
    As with all funding relationships, GCE held the power in the funder-grantee relationship. But being aware and conscious of the effects of that power dynamic is an area where GCE could have done better, according to grantees: “in theory the money is open, but [GCE is] the least aware of the power and influence they have over their partners,” said one participant. The problems we heard stemming from this lack of awareness about power dynamics mainly fell into two categories.

    First, participants mentioned to us that, when people who represented GCE made a request, they did not always feel able to respond with anything other than “yes,” fearing that seeming uncooperative might have a negative effect on their funding. This held true even when the request was presented as friendly or optional, or as personal rather than coming from GCE. Even people who feel confident about pushing back on topics directly related to their funding, like metrics, weren’t always willing to take the risk of pushing back on requests that seemed to be more personal or casual.

    Second, we also heard from participants who felt that GCE had sometimes overstepped by contacting their networks. Speaking to people related to a particular organization is often a standard part of a funder’s due diligence process. When participants became aware of this due diligence after the fact, they often expressed feeling embarrassed and ashamed that their networks were contacted without their knowledge. These situations caused participants to worry that GCE had harmed their social capital by potentially presenting their organization in an unflattering or what they considered inaccurate light.

    We heard from grantees that they often do not feel comfortable being honest about their areas of weakness in conversation with their ILs. When grantees conceal their weaknesses, it is sometimes motivated by the power differential at play. But it can also be motivated by respect and admiration. An individual who wants to be seen as successful and a strong asset to an organization they admire (e.g., Luminate) is not as likely to speak openly about problems.

      you fund, by, for example, intentionally engaging with organizations beyond
      the types of entities and approaches that you are most familiar and comfortable
      with, and questioning your frame of reference for what is ‘a fit.’

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

  insight_title: A funder’s reputation impacts the funder-grantee relationship.
  short_description: In addition to providing an organization needed resources, a
    funding relationship establishes a public connection between the grantee and the
    funder, which can provide meaningful validation or, in some cases, bring up reputational
    challenges for grantees.

    quote: "“Their stamp of approval means a lot.”"
  long_description: |+
    In regions where Omidyar Network (ON) is established, receiving funding can mark an organization as stable, competent, professional, and committed to measurable impact. In regions where ON is less established, the funding can label an organization as either a rising star or as one of the top players in the field. The ON stamp of approval has the potential to make organizations much more attractive to other funders. Participants were aware that other funding decisions appear to be and can be influenced by receiving ON funding. As this research was conducted prior the launch of Luminate's brand, it is important to note that the brand and reputation that is spoken of is tied strongly to the name “Omidyar” (ON).

    In contrast, many participants expressed concerns that the optics of their organization publically accepting support from a “Silicon Valley” funder could be a liability, particularly in contexts hostile to capitalism or corporate donors (e.g., social projects that are critical of free-market liberalism, or media projects critical of big tech). These concerns have been heightened due to global tensions around philanthropy, influence and power.

  insight_title: A lack of transparency around how diversity, equity and inclusion
    (DEI) is valued and integrated into a funder’s work can lead to questions about
    a funder’s commitment to DEI.
  short_description: Funders need to be transparent about how diversity, equity and
    inclusion (DEI) are valued and integrated internally in order to authentically
    engage grantees on these issues. Not doing so can lead organizations to question
    the funder’s commitment to DEI, and the extent to which DEI informs organizational
    culture and plays into both funding and internal processes.

  long_description: "Interviewees mentioned in multiple contexts that GCE did not
    appear to them to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Organizations
    questioned whether and how DEI played into the funding process and GCE’s internal
    practices.\n\nParticipants would welcome a more direct and transparent approach
    to the values of DEI at Luminate. Participants sometimes ascribed frustration
    with systemic discrimination problems happening in Silicon Valley onto GCE as
    well, due to their perception that GCE’s approach was aligned with more negative
    aspects of Silicon Valley’s cutlure. Some participants even spoke about not bringing
    up DEI-related issues with GCE, saying that they didn’t think GCE would be able
    to help or even understand. For these participants, their perception of GCE was
    of an organization that was heteronormative, white, and male.\n\nSeveral participants
    also found it noteworthy that there was no diversity data on the Omidyar Network
    / GCE website. They also remarked on the fact that the team did not ask for any
    diversity data during the investment process.\n\nParticipants were generally aware
    that GCE used DEI considerations in their assessment of an organization, but it
    seems that not all ILs involve grantees in the collection or reporting of that
    information about the organization.\n\n__NOTES:__ \n\nTransparency is a key component
    to fostering an equitable playing field amongst grantees. Transparency ensures
    that information about funding processes and supports are made clear to all, rather
    than offered through informal channels only to grantees in a social position to
    initiate a discussion or inquiry.\n\nLuminate offers direct support around diversity,
    equity, and inclusion—e.g., in the form of diversity consultants\" works\n\n\n"

      Adopting responsible data practices can feel daunting. The issues involved range widely, from privacy to ethics, to many other grey areas around making good judgements when it comes to working with data. This resource covers a few considerations that arise repeatedly when thinking about and practising responsible data in the community.

  page_title: Funder Roles
  insight_short: Funder Roles
  insight_title: When funders wear multiple hats — as individual advocates as well
    as representatives of a funding organization — it can be unclear which role the
    funder is playing at any given time.
  short_description: The power dynamic of the funder-grantee relationship is always
    present, even when the individuals from organizations are interacting in other
    contexts. If funders are also going to be active in the spaces where their grantees
    work, then they need to clearly communicate which role they are in, so as not
    to unintentionally overstep or blur the funder-grantee relationship.

  long_description: |
    The confusion was exacerbated by the fact that GCE saw itself as an “operational funder” (and still does as Luminate). This can be broadly defined as a funding organization that engages in direct advocacy as well as also supporting the policy and advocacy goals of organizations in the field.

    Challenges arose when members of GCE’s staff were seen to be wearing multiple hats – as individual advocates as well as representatives of a funding organization. When individual staff express support for something, people hearing it are not always able to determine if the statement of support means 1) this is interesting work that someone should be doing that aligns with GCE’s priorities, 2) this is a priority for a direct operational play by GCE, or 3) this is critical to the social-political moment in general.

    Some participants voiced concerns about funders also acting as advocates, as funders naturally have a position of power in the space and have access to knowledge not available to other advocates. Others pointed out that GCE’s success depended on its staff taking the time to develop very clear opinions and stances on particular issues, which naturally leads to a more “activist” position.

    page_title: Be Explicit About Roles
    recommendation: Be explicit about __which role you are playing at a given time
      (as both a funder and advocate in the field)__, understand where the boundaries
      of that role lie, and be aware of the conflict that may crop up when switching
      roles. This is relevant both in private (e.g., in a conversation with a prospective
      grantee) and in public (e.g., when writing a white paper).
