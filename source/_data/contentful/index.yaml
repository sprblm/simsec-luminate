  report_title: On Trust & Transparency
  report_subtitle: Perspectives from Luminate's portfolio
  intro_copy: 'In June 2018, Luminate commissioned Simply Secure to conduct human-centered
    design (HCD) research focused on uncovering grantees’ experiences of the funding
    process. The public report highlights insights, feedback — including anonymized
    quotes and comments, and recommendations synthesized from 20 interviews + 53 survey
    responses.

    '
  themes_copy: 'In synthesizing the conversations and survey feedback into insights
    and recommendations, four thematic areas emerged: Funding Approach & Process,
    Trust & Power, Funder Identity & Culture, and Assessing Impact. Each insight has
    been associated with one or more of the themes to provide an organizing framework
    for these interdependent concepts.'
  findings_copy: Explore the nine key insights that emerged from the interviews and
    survey around the grantee experience. With each insight are anonymized quotes
    from the interviews, a description, related recommendations and any relevant resources
    related to the methodology and the insight or recommendations themselves.
  recommendations_copy: Explore the thirty-four recommendations that build from the
    insights, participant interviews and the survey. Recommendations have been mapped
    to resources, insights and themes and include any relevant resources related to
    the methodology and the insight or recommendations themselves.
