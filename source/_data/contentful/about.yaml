    In June 2018, Luminate commissioned Simply Secure to conduct human- centered research focused on understanding granteesâ€™ experiences of the funding process. This is the public report from that research - a collaboration between Luminate, formerly the Governance & Citizen Engagement (GCE) Initiative at Omidyar Network, and Simply Secure. The interviews and survey were conducted over the course of July - September 2018.
