  description: "## From Governance & Citizen Engagement initiative to Luminate\n\nEstablished
    in 2018 by Pierre and Pam Omidyar, [Luminate](https://luminategroup.com/) is a
    global philanthropic organisation with the goal of empowering people and institutions
    to work together to build just and fair societies. We do this by funding and supporting
    non-profit and for-profit organisations and advocating for policies and actions
    that will help people participate in and shape the issues affecting their lives,
    and make those in power more transparent, responsive, and accountable. We prioritise
    delivering impact in four interconnected areas that underpin strong societies:
    Civic Empowerment, Data & Digital Rights, Financial Transparency, and Independent
    Media.\n\nFor more than 10 years we were the Governance & Citizen Engagement (GCE)
    initiative at Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm set up by Pierre
    Omidyar, the founder of eBay. Over that time, we grew as a global team and supported
    more than 200 organisations in 18 countries with more than US $300 million of
    grants and investments.\nThe decision to establish Luminate was driven by two
    critical factors: first, the need to respond robustly to the [complex and connected
    issues we were seeing emerge in the current political and social environment](https://luminategroup.com/storage/334/Luminate-Strategic-Plan-2018-2022.pdf);
    and second, the changing needs of our investees as they work to achieve greater
    impact, often in the face of fast-moving and sometimes unpredictable challenges.\n\n##
    Evaluating our practices using a human-centred lens\n\nThe journey to becoming
    Luminate required that we reflect deeply on our first ten years. A critical part
    of that process was to listen to the experiences of our primary stakeholders –
    our investees. As part of Omidyar Network, we had as a team engaged in previous
    efforts to collect feedback from our portfolio, including via [the Center for
    Effective Philanthropy Grantee Perceptions Survey](https://cep.org/assessments/grantee-and-applicant-perception-reports-3/)
    (in 2014) and the Partner Voice Survey (in 2017) – a bespoke survey of Omidyar
    Network’s portfolio, to dig deeper on opportunities for improvement.\n\nBuilding
    on the insights from those efforts, we commissioned [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/),
    a non-profit organisation specialising in human-centred design with a focus on
    privacy, security and transparency, to undertake a feedback gathering process
    between July-September 2018, using a human-centred research approach. Human-centred
    research is grounded in empathy and takes the approach that understanding the
    experiences, needs and values of people, in this case our investees, is essential
    to developing practices and processes that serve them best. The purpose was to
    gain a deeper understanding of our investees’ experiences and perspectives and
    to generate actionable insights to improve our work and practices that would better
    centre our investment practices around their needs.\n\nWe are excited to share
    the outcomes of that research in this report. Whilst many of the issues will be
    well known in the philanthropic community, we see value in publicly sharing this
    report to: 1) acknowledge the insights that have emerged from our portfolio; 2)
    establish a baseline against which we can evaluate ourselves in the future; and
    3) contribute to the ongoing discussion of funders’ responsibilities and the importance
    of understanding and addressing the needs of those we fund. \n\n## Parallel, complementary
    efforts\n\nThe research process and drafting of this report coincided with ongoing
    efforts by our team to improve investing processes and practices and re-establish
    the values and principles that we will operate by. As such, several changes have
    already been made that go some way in addressing the recommendations in the report.
    These include:\n\n__Transparency around our strategy and investment processes__\n\n-
    We launched a new [website](https://luminategroup.com/) in October 2018, that
    articulates Luminate’s mission and values, our policies, and our history as an
    organisation. The website also includes an [overview of our investment process](https://luminategroup.com/grants-and-investments)
    and investing FAQs.\n- We published our [2018-2022 Strategic Plan](https://luminategroup.com/posts/blog/evolving-strategy-for-changing-times)
    for the first time in January 2019.\n- We launched our [investment database](https://luminategroup.com/portfolio)
    which contains the details of our current investments and grants in June 2019.\n\n\n__Diversity,
    equity and inclusion__\n\n- We published a [blog](https://luminategroup.com/posts/news/on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion)
    in December 2018 which articulates our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion
    (DEI), and introduces some of our work on the topic since our launch. This includes
    publishing our policy document outlining our DEI priorities on our website, revamping
    our diligence process to account for inclusive workplace issues, and clarifying
    our legal documentation to ensure it includes specific language which commits
    our investees to upholding values and principles related to inclusive workplaces
    that mirror our own commitments. \n\n\n__Investment management__\n\n- __Portfolio
    support:__ We are working to prioritise portfolio management and help our organisations
    to build capacity and resilience (e.g., executive coaching, fundraising support,
    digital security trainings, or diversity, equity and inclusion reviews). As such,
    we developed a portfolio support function in January 2019 and are building this
    out.\n- __Learning & Impact:__ We hired a Director of Learning & Impact, who began
    in May 2019, and will be working to improve our approach to monitoring, learning,
    and impact evaluation.\n\n## Implementing the recommendations\n\nAs mentioned
    above, we have already taken efforts to become more investee-centred, and we were
    pleased that the importance of such initiatives was emphasised in Simply Secure’s
    research and subsequent recommendations. We will continue working to better understand
    and consider how we can integrate the other insights and recommendations from
    this research into our practices and future decision-making, and will keep you
    updated as to how we get along. We will also explore possible opportunities to
    utilise human-centred design methods in our work more broadly.\n\nThere are inherent
    challenges in any funding relationship, and we won’t always get things right the
    first time. But we commit to listening and communicating more, continuing to reflect
    and improve on our practices, and we ask you, as our investees and peers, to hold
    us accountable for this.\n\nWe hope that in doing so, we can work in partnership
    to build stronger societies.\n\n__Stephen King__  \n__CEO, Luminate__  \n*__June
