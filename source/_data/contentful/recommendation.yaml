  page_title: Be Explicit About Roles
  recommendation: Be explicit about __which role you are playing at a given time (as
    both a funder and advocate in the field)__, understand where the boundaries of
    that role lie, and be aware of the conflict that may crop up when switching roles.
    This is relevant both in private (e.g., in a conversation with a prospective grantee)
    and in public (e.g., when writing a white paper).

  page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
  recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
    communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their own
    challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
    are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
    and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.
