    insight_title: Grantees value deep and trusting relationships with funders, grounded
      in subject area expertise.
    short_description: 'A strong relationship between the funder and grantee builds
      trust, enabling the grantee to take more initiative and negotiate for their
      needs. Partnering with an investment lead (IL) or program officer with subject
      area expertise is especially critical for grantees to feel like their work is
      understood. '

    long_description: "The investment lead (IL) was seen by participants as the face
      of GCE for grantees.* A positive experience with an IL reflects very well on
      the organization as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly
      valued.\n\nThe ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel
      understood and heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with
      GCE as a team. One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional,
      constructive, and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.”
      \n\nOrganizations who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly
      positive about their IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention
      they received. “They’ve truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators
      in our work as they do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s
      openness to collaboration and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive
      for those who had taken the initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who
      were confident enough to push back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting
      — felt respected and heard, and often got what they asked for. Having pushed
      back didn’t seem to hurt their reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything,
      it seemed to lead to greater mutual respect.\n\n*Investment Lead (IL) is a similar
      role to a Program Officer at a foundation."

    insight_title: When funders wear multiple hats — as individual advocates as well
      as representatives of a funding organization — it can be unclear which role
      the funder is playing at any given time.
    short_description: The power dynamic of the funder-grantee relationship is always
      present, even when the individuals from organizations are interacting in other
      contexts. If funders are also going to be active in the spaces where their grantees
      work, then they need to clearly communicate which role they are in, so as not
      to unintentionally overstep or blur the funder-grantee relationship.
    featured_quote:

    long_description: "The confusion was exacerbated by the fact that GCE saw itself
      as an “operational funder” (and still does as Luminate). This can be broadly
      defined as a funding organization that engages in direct advocacy as well as
      also supporting the policy and advocacy goals of organizations in the field.\n\nChallenges
      arose when members of GCE’s staff were seen to be wearing multiple hats – as
      individual advocates as well as representatives of a funding organization. When
      individual staff express support for something, people hearing it are not always
      able to determine if the statement of support means 1) this is interesting work
      that someone should be doing that aligns with GCE’s priorities, 2) this is a
      priority for a direct operational play by GCE, or 3) this is critical to the
      social-political moment in general. \n\nSome participants voiced concerns about
      funders also acting as advocates, as funders naturally have a position of power
      in the space and have access to knowledge not available to other advocates.
      Others pointed out that GCE’s success depended on its staff taking the time
      to develop very clear opinions and stances on particular issues, which naturally
      leads to a more “activist” position."

    insight_title: Grantees are interested in and looking for portfolio support, and
      would like more clarity, autonomy, and choice in how they access and receive
      that support.
    short_description: Grantees have many organizational health needs that can be
      met by connecting them with the right resources, such as other organizations,
      consultants, services, mentors or vendors. However, it is important that the
      process for accessing this support and the context in which it is provided is
      clear, to avoid it being seen as punitive.

    long_description: "Participants expressed interest in the following portfolio
      support* areas:\n\n- Recruiting and hiring: Growth and scaling were important concerns
      for many of the respondents, and in some cases “growth” was understood to mean hiring people
      to help meet metrics. Grantees see a need for active recruiting and hiring support.\n-
      Financial management: Both survey respondents and interview participants strongly
      agreed that GCE had expertise in financial management.\n- Fundraising: 88% of
      survey respondents indicated that fundraising support was extremely desirable.\n-
      Networking, outreach and community development: Interview participants appreciated
      the sense of belonging that came from attending GCE gatherings and viewed access
      to other grantees as valuable. They also appreciated when GCE helped to expand
      their reach, e.g., on social media by “signal boosting” or promoting their work.\n-
      Evaluation and audits: Organizations that have undergone an evaluation or audit
      generally reported positive experiences.\n\nKnowing that this kind of additional
      support existed wasn’t enough for organizations to feel that GCE was meeting
      their specific needs, because there was no framework for taking advantage of
      the offers.  \n\nSome participants expressed concerns about accepting alternative
      portfolio support from GCE, due to the power difference inherent in the funding
      relationship and the implications of admitting weakness to a funder. Their concerns
      ranged from not being able to pick or change who the service provider is to
      wondering if the service provider would “spy” on them and report weaknesses
      to GCE. \n\nThese concerns were tied to participants not having clarity about
      why support was being offered and to what end – was it because GCE was keen
      to help proactively build organizational capacity, or was it because they were
      performing badly and GCE was intervening? This concern may indicate a lack of
      underlying trust; some participants indicated that they could not be sure that
      GCE had their best interests in mind, and therefore were hesitant to share challenges
      or accept support.\n\nIn the past, GCE ILs have provided portfolio support by
      taking seats on select grantees’ boards. This is a unique practice in the non-profit
      funding sector, and was generally met with skepticism. Over one-third of survey
      respondents believed that the practice of GCE holding board seats was not at
      all helpful for their organization. Their reasons included fear of sharing internal
      problems with a funder present, power or knowledge asymmetry, negative perceptions
      by third parties of having a funder on the board, and concerns that representing
      GCE’s interests would take priority over acting in the grantee’s best interest.
      There was a qualitative difference in the sentiments of those observing the
      practice of GCE taking board seats and those experiencing it. Survey respondents
      who had a member of GCE staff on their board, viewed this participation more
      positively than those respondents who didn’t. \n\nThere was a positive correlation
      between GCE’s participation on an organization’s board and that organization’s
      perception of the ease of communication with GCE.  Leaders of organizations
      with a board member or observer felt much more comfortable asking for help,
      implying a closer relationship and more open channels of communication.\n\nWhat
      most organizations appreciated from board members was strategic advice, operational
      support, and connections to the ecosystem.\n\n*Portfolio support refers to specifically
      earmarked support, above and beyond grant funding, to build organizational capacity
      and resilience. Examples include executive coaching, fundraising support, digital
      security trainings, or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reviews."

    long_description: "### Reporting Processes\n\nIn the best case, quarterly and
      annual reports serve as much more than just an update or checkup. Reporting
      can be an integral part of creating a common understanding of the organization’s
      goals and core mission. Some participants stated that creating reports helped
      them hone their organizational focus. \n\nBut in other cases, reporting was
      seen as busy work that takes time away from what organizations saw as their
      “real work.” These participants viewed the report as a deliverable external
      to their organizational goals. This group also expressed doubts about the utility
      of their reports to GCE, since they rarely heard feedback after submitting reports.
      \n\nAmong the people who were the most satisfied with reports, many of them
      had negotiated a reporting format that worked for them. For example, some organizations
      sent one standardized report to all of their funders, so they didn’t have to
      spend time preparing multiple reports. Others worked with GCE to develop a specific
      format that best fit both their needs and GCE’s. We noticed that the organizations
      who took the initiative to make reporting work well for them were more likely
      to see the real outcome as not the report itself, but as a benefit to their
      organization’s health. On average, organizations reported that narrative reports
      are more cumbersome to produce than financial reports, but almost all respondents
      felt narrative reports were a clearer reflection of the organization. \n\n\n###
      Metrics & Benchmarks\n\nWhen we explored the topic of reporting with interviewees,
      the conversation often turned to the metrics that are, for organizations, tightly
      linked with reporting.\n\nMost organizations had experience with impact measurement
      of some kind, though sometimes at a less rigorous level than GCE’s standards.
      As with reporting formats, participants who pushed back on initial metrics,
      and as a result collaborated to create metrics they found more meaningful and
      useful, were the most satisfied and positive about their metrics. The chance
      to create impact metrics together with GCE was described as a helpful learning
      experience. In particular, some participants noted the value of being exposed
      to learning measurement techniques associated with the commercial sector. \n\nThe
      negative comments about metrics came from participants who felt that metrics
      were handed to them without opportunities for discussion and revision, and thus
      were neither reasonable nor applicable to their strategy and impact model. One
      participant noted that they were “burdened with measurable but unfair metrics
      and expectations.” Another commented that meeting metrics would only be possible
      if they behaved unethically. These organizations generally saw metrics as a
      way to quantitatively describe outputs, rather than a way to monitor outcomes. "

    insight_title: Grantees crave structure and clarity with regards to 1) the funding
      process and what to expect from the relationship once funded, and 2) shifting
      strategic priorities.
    short_description: Structured funding processes, clear communication about strategic
      priorities, and how to secure funding are critical. Without this, potential
      grantees have inconsistent experiences and misunderstandings can arise.
    featured_quote:
      sys:
        id: 2kEoS4hHqkxrm6zVDLJ9Qj
    long_description: "When we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
      all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not
      likely to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure
      in the IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere
      on the spectrum between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions
      – and “hands-off” – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both
      extremes have advantages and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions”
      was associated with a lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even
      favoritism.\n\nIn more hands-on relationships, organizations felt they had received
      bespoke engagement from GCE, often describing their ILs as mentors and partners.
      This makes them feel unique and valued, and allows organizations to ask for
      help when they need it.\n\nHowever, some participants told us that a hands-on
      approach isn’t always better. The downside of a personalized, high-touch experience
      is that grantees struggled to explain how GCE made decisions. When asked about
      the main factors in GCE’s funding decision, many interviewees said they could
      not generalize because “[their] case was an outlier.” \n\nOn the other hand,
      a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily mean that all organizations receive
      the same treatment. While some organizations praised the efficiency of a standardized
      funding process and stated that they have more trust in a standardized process,
      many organizations with a “low-touch” relationship with GCE felt that their
      needs were not being met. They were more likely to see other grantees as competitors
      for GCE’s attention.\n\n\n### Structure & Clarity: The Funding Process\n\nMany
      participants said they were uncertain about what to expect before and during
      the process. For example, some interviewees expressed bewilderment about the
      role of the investment committee.* This confusion translated into insecurity
      about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel might not
      be appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered about how
      much information they should share with their IL, especially information that
      might make their organization look bad, and how much of that would then be shared
      with the investment committee, who they would likely not have met for the first
      time until the end of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration
      with burdensome processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people
      from GCE. Over two-thirds of interviewees bemoaned a process that was long,
      difficult, and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.” \n\nThey reported
      being asked to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information,
      sending the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some
      participants mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment
      process particularly stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would
      receive a final decision from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n###
      Structure & Clarity: Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees repeatedly mentioned that
      the value of their relationship with GCE was more than financial. While part
      of the GCE portfolio or network (as grantees referred to it), they were able
      to take advantage of the GCE/ON stamp of approval, enjoy publicity and attention
      through their connection with GCE/ON, and reap the benefits of a personal relationship
      with their IL (often a powerful player in their field). \n\nSince the personal
      relationship with the IL is a signature component of being part of the network,
      being transitioned out of the portfolio can feel like a personal betrayal. Some
      participants, that have received longer-term support from GCE, felt that new
      projects were competitors not just for money but also for attention. Concerns
      were raised based on what they knew of other organization’s experiences, and
      fears over the stability of their own funding.\n\nThis feeling of personal betrayal
      also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees working in the
      space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. Some participants
      noted that when GCE pivoted to a different investment strategy, focusing on
      new and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issue areas felt rejected.
      It is not only a financial, but also an emotional matter to lose the support
      of GCE, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent power imbalances in the
      funder-grantee relationship.\n\n*The investment committee is the approval committee
      for grants and investments."

    page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
    recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__ in
      communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around their
      own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their experiences
      are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate a more productive
      and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

    long_description: "The investment lead (IL) was seen by participants as the face
      of GCE for grantees.* A positive experience with an IL reflects very well on
      the organization as a whole. IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly
      valued.\n\nThe ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel
      understood and heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with
      GCE as a team. One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional,
      constructive, and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.”
      \n\nOrganizations who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly
      positive about their IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention
      they received. “They’ve truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators
      in our work as they do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey. \n\nGCE’s
      openness to collaboration and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive
      for those who had taken the initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who
      were confident enough to push back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting
      — felt respected and heard, and often got what they asked for. Having pushed
      back didn’t seem to hurt their reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything,
      it seemed to lead to greater mutual respect.\n\n*Investment Lead (IL) is a similar
      role to a Program Officer at a foundation."

      page_title: Transparency and Honesty in Communications with Grantees
      recommendation: Look for opportunities to __model transparency and honesty__
        in communications with grantees. Greater transparency from funders around
        their own challenges and failures will help grantees by reinforcing that their
        experiences are normal, expected, and worthy of support, and will facilitate
        a more productive and beneficial funding relationship for both parties.

    insight_short: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
    insight_title: A lack of transparency around how diversity, equity and inclusion
      (DEI) is valued and integrated into a funder’s work can lead to questions about
      a funder’s commitment to DEI.
    short_description: Funders need to be transparent about how diversity, equity
      and inclusion (DEI) are valued and integrated internally in order to authentically
      engage grantees on these issues. Not doing so can lead organizations to question
      the funder’s commitment to DEI, and the extent to which DEI informs organizational
      culture and plays into both funding and internal processes.

    long_description: "Interviewees mentioned in multiple contexts that GCE did not
      appear to them to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Organizations
      questioned whether and how DEI played into the funding process and GCE’s internal
      practices. \n\nParticipants would welcome a more direct and transparent approach
      to the values of DEI at Luminate. Participants sometimes ascribed frustration
      with systemic discrimination problems happening in Silicon Valley onto GCE as
      well, due to their perception that GCE’s approach was aligned with more negative
      aspects of Silicon Valley’s culture. Some participants even spoke about not
      bringing up DEI-related issues with GCE, saying that they didn’t think GCE would
      be able to help or even understand. For these participants, their perception
      of GCE was of an organization that was heteronormative, white, and male.\n\nSeveral
      participants also found it noteworthy that there was no diversity data on the
      Omidyar Network / GCE website. They also remarked on the fact that the team
      did not ask for any diversity data during the investment process.\n\nParticipants
      were generally aware that GCE used DEI considerations in their assessment of
      an organization, but it seems that not all ILs involved grantees in the collection
      or reporting of that information about the organization.\n\n__NOTES:__ \n\nTransparency
      is key to fostering an equitable playing field amongst grantees. Transparency
      ensures that information about funding processes and support are made clear
      to all, rather than offered through informal channels only to grantees in a
      position to initiate a discussion or inquiry. \n"

    insight_title: A funder’s reputation impacts the funder-grantee relationship.
    short_description: In addition to providing an organization needed resources,
      a funding relationship establishes a public connection between the grantee and
      the funder, which can provide meaningful validation or, in some cases, bring
      up reputational challenges for grantees.

      In regions where Omidyar Network (ON) is established, receiving funding can mark an organization as stable, competent, professional, and committed to measurable impact. In regions where ON is less established, the funding can label an organization as either a rising star or as one of the top players in the field. The ON stamp of approval has the potential to make organizations much more attractive to other funders. Participants were aware that other funding decisions appear to be and can be influenced by receiving ON funding. As this research was conducted prior to the launch of Luminate’s brand, it is important to note that the brand and reputation that is spoken of is tied strongly to the name “Omidyar” (ON).

      In contrast, many participants expressed concerns that the optics of their organization publically accepting support from a “Silicon Valley” funder could be a liability, particularly in contexts hostile to capitalism or corporate donors (e.g., social projects that are critical of free-market liberalism, or media projects critical of big tech). These concerns have been heightened due to global tensions around philanthropy, influence and power.

    insight_title: Grantees are interested in and looking for portfolio support, and
      would like more clarity, autonomy, and choice in how they access and receive
      that support.
    short_description: Grantees have many organizational health needs that can be
      met by connecting them with the right resources, such as other organizations,
      consultants, services, mentors or vendors. However, it is important that the
      process for accessing this support and the context in which it is provided is
      clear, to avoid it being seen as punitive.

    long_description: "Participants expressed interest in the following portfolio
      support* areas:\n\n- Recruiting and hiring: Growth and scaling were important concerns
      for many of the respondents, and in some cases “growth” was understood to mean hiring people
      to help meet metrics. Grantees see a need for active recruiting and hiring support.\n-
      Financial management: Both survey respondents and interview participants strongly
      agreed that GCE had expertise in financial management.\n- Fundraising: 88% of
      survey respondents indicated that fundraising support was extremely desirable.\n-
      Networking, outreach and community development: Interview participants appreciated
      the sense of belonging that came from attending GCE gatherings and viewed access
      to other grantees as valuable. They also appreciated when GCE helped to expand
      their reach, e.g., on social media by “signal boosting” or promoting their work.\n-
      Evaluation and audits: Organizations that have undergone an evaluation or audit
      generally reported positive experiences.\n\nKnowing that this kind of additional
      support existed wasn’t enough for organizations to feel that GCE was meeting
      their specific needs, because there was no framework for taking advantage of
      the offers.  \n\nSome participants expressed concerns about accepting alternative
      portfolio support from GCE, due to the power difference inherent in the funding
      relationship and the implications of admitting weakness to a funder. Their concerns
      ranged from not being able to pick or change who the service provider is to
      wondering if the service provider would “spy” on them and report weaknesses
      to GCE. \n\nThese concerns were tied to participants not having clarity about
      why support was being offered and to what end – was it because GCE was keen
      to help proactively build organizational capacity, or was it because they were
      performing badly and GCE was intervening? This concern may indicate a lack of
      underlying trust; some participants indicated that they could not be sure that
      GCE had their best interests in mind, and therefore were hesitant to share challenges
      or accept support.\n\nIn the past, GCE ILs have provided portfolio support by
      taking seats on select grantees’ boards. This is a unique practice in the non-profit
      funding sector, and was generally met with skepticism. Over one-third of survey
      respondents believed that the practice of GCE holding board seats was not at
      all helpful for their organization. Their reasons included fear of sharing internal
      problems with a funder present, power or knowledge asymmetry, negative perceptions
      by third parties of having a funder on the board, and concerns that representing
      GCE’s interests would take priority over acting in the grantee’s best interest.
      There was a qualitative difference in the sentiments of those observing the
      practice of GCE taking board seats and those experiencing it. Survey respondents
      who had a member of GCE staff on their board, viewed this participation more
      positively than those respondents who didn’t. \n\nThere was a positive correlation
      between GCE’s participation on an organization’s board and that organization’s
      perception of the ease of communication with GCE.  Leaders of organizations
      with a board member or observer felt much more comfortable asking for help,
      implying a closer relationship and more open channels of communication.\n\nWhat
      most organizations appreciated from board members was strategic advice, operational
      support, and connections to the ecosystem.\n\n*Portfolio support refers to specifically
      earmarked support, above and beyond grant funding, to build organizational capacity
      and resilience. Examples include executive coaching, fundraising support, digital
      security trainings, or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reviews."

      process and what to expect from the relationship once funded, and 2) shifting
      strategic priorities.
    short_description: Structured funding processes, clear communication about strategic
      priorities, and how to secure funding are critical. Without this, potential
      grantees have inconsistent experiences and misunderstandings can arise.

    long_description: "When we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
      all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not
      likely to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure
      in the IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere
      on the spectrum between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions
      – and “hands-off” – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both
      extremes have advantages and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions”
      was associated with a lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even
      favoritism.\n\nIn more hands-on relationships, organizations felt they had received
      bespoke engagement from GCE, often describing their ILs as mentors and partners.
      This makes them feel unique and valued, and allows organizations to ask for
      help when they need it.\n\nHowever, some participants told us that a hands-on
      approach isn’t always better. The downside of a personalized, high-touch experience
      is that grantees struggled to explain how GCE made decisions. When asked about
      the main factors in GCE’s funding decision, many interviewees said they could
      not generalize because “[their] case was an outlier.” \n\nOn the other hand,
      a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily mean that all organizations receive
      the same treatment. While some organizations praised the efficiency of a standardized
      funding process and stated that they have more trust in a standardized process,
      many organizations with a “low-touch” relationship with GCE felt that their
      needs were not being met. They were more likely to see other grantees as competitors
      for GCE’s attention.\n\n\n### Structure & Clarity: The Funding Process\n\nMany
      participants said they were uncertain about what to expect before and during
      the process. For example, some interviewees expressed bewilderment about the
      role of the investment committee.* This confusion translated into insecurity
      about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel might not
      be appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered about how
      much information they should share with their IL, especially information that
      might make their organization look bad, and how much of that would then be shared
      with the investment committee, who they would likely not have met for the first
      time until the end of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration
      with burdensome processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people
      from GCE. Over two-thirds of interviewees bemoaned a process that was long,
      difficult, and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.” \n\nThey reported
      being asked to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information,
      sending the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some
      participants mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment
      process particularly stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would
      receive a final decision from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n###
      Structure & Clarity: Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees repeatedly mentioned that
      the value of their relationship with GCE was more than financial. While part
      of the GCE portfolio or network (as grantees referred to it), they were able
      to take advantage of the GCE/ON stamp of approval, enjoy publicity and attention
      through their connection with GCE/ON, and reap the benefits of a personal relationship
      with their IL (often a powerful player in their field). \n\nSince the personal
      relationship with the IL is a signature component of being part of the network,
      being transitioned out of the portfolio can feel like a personal betrayal. Some
      participants, that have received longer-term support from GCE, felt that new
      projects were competitors not just for money but also for attention. Concerns
      were raised based on what they knew of other organization’s experiences, and
      fears over the stability of their own funding.\n\nThis feeling of personal betrayal
      also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees working in the
      space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. Some participants
      noted that when GCE pivoted to a different investment strategy, focusing on
      new and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issue areas felt rejected.
      It is not only a financial, but also an emotional matter to lose the support
      of GCE, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent power imbalances in the
      funder-grantee relationship.\n\n*The investment committee is the approval committee
      for grants and investments."

    insight_short: Power Dynamics
    insight_title: Power dynamics, if not acknowledged, can affect the strength and
      quality of funder-grantee relationships.
    short_description: There are inherent power dynamics at play in funding relationships,
      with funders holding a lot power and influence over grantees. Funders that acknowledge
      and, as far as possible, work to address these dynamics, create stronger and
      more successful relationships with their grantees.

        id: 3wnOWJsOwgD8YMQCkAToyf
    long_description: "As with all funding relationships, GCE held the power in the
      funder-grantee relationship. But being aware and conscious of the effects of
      that power dynamic is an area where GCE could have done better, according to
      grantees: “in theory the money is open, but [GCE is] the least aware of the
      power and influence they have over their partners,” said one participant. The
      problems we heard stemming from this lack of awareness about power dynamics
      mainly fell into two categories.\n\nFirst, participants mentioned to us that,
      when people who represented GCE made a request, they did not always feel able
      to respond with anything other than “yes,” fearing that seeming uncooperative
      might have a negative effect on their funding. This held true even when the
      request was presented as friendly or optional, or as personal rather than coming
      from GCE. Even people who feel confident about pushing back on topics directly
      related to their funding, like metrics, weren’t always willing to take the risk
      of pushing back on requests that seemed to be more personal or casual. \n\nSecond,
      we also heard from participants who felt that GCE had sometimes overstepped
      by contacting their networks. Speaking to people related to a particular organization
      is often a standard part of a funder’s due diligence process. When participants
      became aware of this due diligence after the fact, they often expressed feeling
      embarrassed and ashamed that their networks were contacted without their knowledge.
      These situations caused participants to worry that GCE had harmed their social
      capital by potentially presenting their organization in an unflattering or what
      they considered inaccurate light. \n\nWe heard from grantees that they often
      do not feel comfortable being honest about their areas of weakness in conversation
      with their ILs. When grantees conceal their weaknesses, it is sometimes motivated
      by the power differential at play. But it can also be motivated by respect and
      admiration. An individual who wants to be seen as successful and a strong asset
      to an organization they admire (e.g., Luminate) is not as likely to speak openly
      about problems. "

    insight_title: A lack of transparency around how diversity, equity and inclusion
      (DEI) is valued and integrated into a funder’s work can lead to questions about
      a funder’s commitment to DEI.
    short_description: Funders need to be transparent about how diversity, equity
      and inclusion (DEI) are valued and integrated internally in order to authentically
      engage grantees on these issues. Not doing so can lead organizations to question
      the funder’s commitment to DEI, and the extent to which DEI informs organizational
      culture and plays into both funding and internal processes.

    long_description: "Interviewees mentioned in multiple contexts that GCE did not
      appear to them to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Organizations
      questioned whether and how DEI played into the funding process and GCE’s internal
      practices. \n\nParticipants would welcome a more direct and transparent approach
      to the values of DEI at Luminate. Participants sometimes ascribed frustration
      with systemic discrimination problems happening in Silicon Valley onto GCE as
      well, due to their perception that GCE’s approach was aligned with more negative
      aspects of Silicon Valley’s culture. Some participants even spoke about not
      bringing up DEI-related issues with GCE, saying that they didn’t think GCE would
      be able to help or even understand. For these participants, their perception
      of GCE was of an organization that was heteronormative, white, and male.\n\nSeveral
      participants also found it noteworthy that there was no diversity data on the
      Omidyar Network / GCE website. They also remarked on the fact that the team
      did not ask for any diversity data during the investment process.\n\nParticipants
      were generally aware that GCE used DEI considerations in their assessment of
      an organization, but it seems that not all ILs involved grantees in the collection
      or reporting of that information about the organization.\n\n__NOTES:__ \n\nTransparency
      is key to fostering an equitable playing field amongst grantees. Transparency
      ensures that information about funding processes and support are made clear
      to all, rather than offered through informal channels only to grantees in a
      position to initiate a discussion or inquiry. \n"

    insight_title: A funder’s reputation impacts the funder-grantee relationship.
    short_description: In addition to providing an organization needed resources,
      a funding relationship establishes a public connection between the grantee and
      the funder, which can provide meaningful validation or, in some cases, bring
      up reputational challenges for grantees.

      In regions where Omidyar Network (ON) is established, receiving funding can mark an organization as stable, competent, professional, and committed to measurable impact. In regions where ON is less established, the funding can label an organization as either a rising star or as one of the top players in the field. The ON stamp of approval has the potential to make organizations much more attractive to other funders. Participants were aware that other funding decisions appear to be and can be influenced by receiving ON funding. As this research was conducted prior to the launch of Luminate’s brand, it is important to note that the brand and reputation that is spoken of is tied strongly to the name “Omidyar” (ON).

      In contrast, many participants expressed concerns that the optics of their organization publically accepting support from a “Silicon Valley” funder could be a liability, particularly in contexts hostile to capitalism or corporate donors (e.g., social projects that are critical of free-market liberalism, or media projects critical of big tech). These concerns have been heightened due to global tensions around philanthropy, influence and power.

    insight_short: Funder Roles
    insight_title: When funders wear multiple hats — as individual advocates as well
      as representatives of a funding organization — it can be unclear which role
      the funder is playing at any given time.
    short_description: The power dynamic of the funder-grantee relationship is always
      present, even when the individuals from organizations are interacting in other
      contexts. If funders are also going to be active in the spaces where their grantees
      work, then they need to clearly communicate which role they are in, so as not
      to unintentionally overstep or blur the funder-grantee relationship.

    long_description: "The confusion was exacerbated by the fact that GCE saw itself
      as an “operational funder” (and still does as Luminate). This can be broadly
      defined as a funding organization that engages in direct advocacy as well as
      also supporting the policy and advocacy goals of organizations in the field.\n\nChallenges
      arose when members of GCE’s staff were seen to be wearing multiple hats – as
      individual advocates as well as representatives of a funding organization. When
      individual staff express support for something, people hearing it are not always
      able to determine if the statement of support means 1) this is interesting work
      that someone should be doing that aligns with GCE’s priorities, 2) this is a
      priority for a direct operational play by GCE, or 3) this is critical to the
      social-political moment in general. \n\nSome participants voiced concerns about
      funders also acting as advocates, as funders naturally have a position of power
      in the space and have access to knowledge not available to other advocates.
      Others pointed out that GCE’s success depended on its staff taking the time
      to develop very clear opinions and stances on particular issues, which naturally
      leads to a more “activist” position."

    insight_short: Power Dynamics
    insight_title: Power dynamics, if not acknowledged, can affect the strength and
      quality of funder-grantee relationships.
    short_description: There are inherent power dynamics at play in funding relationships,
      with funders holding a lot power and influence over grantees. Funders that acknowledge
      and, as far as possible, work to address these dynamics, create stronger and
      more successful relationships with their grantees.

    long_description: "As with all funding relationships, GCE held the power in the
      funder-grantee relationship. But being aware and conscious of the effects of
      that power dynamic is an area where GCE could have done better, according to
      grantees: “in theory the money is open, but [GCE is] the least aware of the
      power and influence they have over their partners,” said one participant. The
      problems we heard stemming from this lack of awareness about power dynamics
      mainly fell into two categories.\n\nFirst, participants mentioned to us that,
      when people who represented GCE made a request, they did not always feel able
      to respond with anything other than “yes,” fearing that seeming uncooperative
      might have a negative effect on their funding. This held true even when the
      request was presented as friendly or optional, or as personal rather than coming
      from GCE. Even people who feel confident about pushing back on topics directly
      related to their funding, like metrics, weren’t always willing to take the risk
      of pushing back on requests that seemed to be more personal or casual. \n\nSecond,
      we also heard from participants who felt that GCE had sometimes overstepped
      by contacting their networks. Speaking to people related to a particular organization
      is often a standard part of a funder’s due diligence process. When participants
      became aware of this due diligence after the fact, they often expressed feeling
      embarrassed and ashamed that their networks were contacted without their knowledge.
      These situations caused participants to worry that GCE had harmed their social
      capital by potentially presenting their organization in an unflattering or what
      they considered inaccurate light. \n\nWe heard from grantees that they often
      do not feel comfortable being honest about their areas of weakness in conversation
      with their ILs. When grantees conceal their weaknesses, it is sometimes motivated
      by the power differential at play. But it can also be motivated by respect and
      admiration. An individual who wants to be seen as successful and a strong asset
      to an organization they admire (e.g., Luminate) is not as likely to speak openly
      about problems. "

    insight_short: Structure and Clarity
    insight_title: Grantees crave structure and clarity with regards to 1) the funding
      process and what to expect from the relationship once funded, and 2) shifting
      strategic priorities.
    short_description: Structured funding processes, clear communication about strategic
      priorities, and how to secure funding are critical. Without this, potential
      grantees have inconsistent experiences and misunderstandings can arise.

    long_description: "When we asked grantees about their experiences with GCE, almost
      all of them mentioned that theirs was an exceptional or unique case, and not
      likely to be generalizable feedback. This seems to stem from a lack of structure
      in the IL/grantee relationship overall. Funding relationships fall somewhere
      on the spectrum between “hands-on” – meaning customized, high-touch interactions
      – and “hands-off” – meaning more standardized, low-touch interactions. Both
      extremes have advantages and disadvantages. Overall, this “culture of exceptions”
      was associated with a lack of transparency, high unpredictability, and even
      favoritism.\n\nIn more hands-on relationships, organizations felt they had received
      bespoke engagement from GCE, often describing their ILs as mentors and partners.
      This makes them feel unique and valued, and allows organizations to ask for
      help when they need it.\n\nHowever, some participants told us that a hands-on
      approach isn’t always better. The downside of a personalized, high-touch experience
      is that grantees struggled to explain how GCE made decisions. When asked about
      the main factors in GCE’s funding decision, many interviewees said they could
      not generalize because “[their] case was an outlier.” \n\nOn the other hand,
      a hands-off relationship doesn’t necessarily mean that all organizations receive
      the same treatment. While some organizations praised the efficiency of a standardized
      funding process and stated that they have more trust in a standardized process,
      many organizations with a “low-touch” relationship with GCE felt that their
      needs were not being met. They were more likely to see other grantees as competitors
      for GCE’s attention.\n\n\n### Structure & Clarity: The Funding Process\n\nMany
      participants said they were uncertain about what to expect before and during
      the process. For example, some interviewees expressed bewilderment about the
      role of the investment committee.* This confusion translated into insecurity
      about whether they can trust their ILs with information they feel might not
      be appropriate to share with the investment committee. They wondered about how
      much information they should share with their IL, especially information that
      might make their organization look bad, and how much of that would then be shared
      with the investment committee, who they would likely not have met for the first
      time until the end of a long process.\n\nSome participants mentioned frustration
      with burdensome processes that lasted over a year and involved multiple people
      from GCE. Over two-thirds of interviewees bemoaned a process that was long,
      difficult, and opaque – one even called it “unprofessional.” \n\nThey reported
      being asked to submit documents on short notice, and having to repeat information,
      sending the same or very similar information to multiple people at GCE. Some
      participants mentioned that they found certain periods during the investment
      process particularly stressful, such as when they weren’t sure if they would
      receive a final decision from GCE or just a request for more documentation.\n\n###
      Structure & Clarity: Shift in Priorities\n\nGrantees repeatedly mentioned that
      the value of their relationship with GCE was more than financial. While part
      of the GCE portfolio or network (as grantees referred to it), they were able
      to take advantage of the GCE/ON stamp of approval, enjoy publicity and attention
      through their connection with GCE/ON, and reap the benefits of a personal relationship
      with their IL (often a powerful player in their field). \n\nSince the personal
      relationship with the IL is a signature component of being part of the network,
      being transitioned out of the portfolio can feel like a personal betrayal. Some
      participants, that have received longer-term support from GCE, felt that new
      projects were competitors not just for money but also for attention. Concerns
      were raised based on what they knew of other organization’s experiences, and
      fears over the stability of their own funding.\n\nThis feeling of personal betrayal
      also goes beyond the relationship with the IL. Many grantees working in the
      space deeply identify with the issues they are working on. Some participants
      noted that when GCE pivoted to a different investment strategy, focusing on
      new and emerging issues, people working in the “old” issue areas felt rejected.
      It is not only a financial, but also an emotional matter to lose the support
      of GCE, and one that can be seen to reflect inherent power imbalances in the
      funder-grantee relationship.\n\n*The investment committee is the approval committee
      for grants and investments."

    long_description: "### Reporting Processes\n\nIn the best case, quarterly and
      annual reports serve as much more than just an update or checkup. Reporting
      can be an integral part of creating a common understanding of the organization’s
      goals and core mission. Some participants stated that creating reports helped
      them hone their organizational focus. \n\nBut in other cases, reporting was
      seen as busy work that takes time away from what organizations saw as their
      “real work.” These participants viewed the report as a deliverable external
      to their organizational goals. This group also expressed doubts about the utility
      of their reports to GCE, since they rarely heard feedback after submitting reports.
      \n\nAmong the people who were the most satisfied with reports, many of them
      had negotiated a reporting format that worked for them. For example, some organizations
      sent one standardized report to all of their funders, so they didn’t have to
      spend time preparing multiple reports. Others worked with GCE to develop a specific
      format that best fit both their needs and GCE’s. We noticed that the organizations
      who took the initiative to make reporting work well for them were more likely
      to see the real outcome as not the report itself, but as a benefit to their
      organization’s health. On average, organizations reported that narrative reports
      are more cumbersome to produce than financial reports, but almost all respondents
      felt narrative reports were a clearer reflection of the organization. \n\n\n###
      Metrics & Benchmarks\n\nWhen we explored the topic of reporting with interviewees,
      the conversation often turned to the metrics that are, for organizations, tightly
      linked with reporting.\n\nMost organizations had experience with impact measurement
      of some kind, though sometimes at a less rigorous level than GCE’s standards.
      As with reporting formats, participants who pushed back on initial metrics,
      and as a result collaborated to create metrics they found more meaningful and
      useful, were the most satisfied and positive about their metrics. The chance
      to create impact metrics together with GCE was described as a helpful learning
      experience. In particular, some participants noted the value of being exposed
      to learning measurement techniques associated with the commercial sector. \n\nThe
      negative comments about metrics came from participants who felt that metrics
      were handed to them without opportunities for discussion and revision, and thus
      were neither reasonable nor applicable to their strategy and impact model. One
      participant noted that they were “burdened with measurable but unfair metrics
      and expectations.” Another commented that meeting metrics would only be possible
      if they behaved unethically. These organizations generally saw metrics as a
      way to quantitatively describe outputs, rather than a way to monitor outcomes. "
