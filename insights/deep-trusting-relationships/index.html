The interviews and survey were conducted over the course of July - September 2018.</p><p><a href="https://ontrustandtransparency.report/project-details">Learn more about the project</a></p></div><div class="column large-12 medium-12 small-12 underline-link underline-link--white"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/h8kgu1arvxtu/7xku46Av2bRp4URFz3l19j/c5f8e07675ba2785face65e25fef5c11/simsec-logo.svg" alt="Simply Secure Logo"><p>Simply Secure is a US 501(c)3 non-profit building a community of practitioners that puts people at the center of privacy, security, and transparency.

IL’s with deep subject area knowledge are particularly valued.</p><p>The ILs’ extensive knowledge about the space made the grantees feel understood and heard, and contributed to an overall feeling of alignment with GCE as a team. One participant expressed this as really valuing the “professional, constructive, and encouraging thinking partner that our contact (IL) embodies.”</p><p>Organizations who had a close relationship with their ILs were uniformly positive about their IL’s capabilities and the amount of personal attention they received. “They’ve truly felt as much like thought partners and co-conspirators in our work as they do funders,” wrote one organization in the survey.</p><p>GCE’s openness to collaboration and negotiation was regarded as extremely positive for those who had taken the initiative to take advantage of it. Grantees who were confident enough to push back — usually with regard to metrics or reporting — felt respected and heard, and often got what they asked for. Having pushed back didn’t seem to hurt their reputation or relationship with GCE – if anything, it seemed to lead to greater mutual respect.</p><p>*Investment Lead (IL) is a similar role to a Program Officer at a foundation.</p></div><div class="column large-4"><div class="themes-quotes-container"><div class="themes"><h3>Themes</h3><a href="/themes/funding-approach-process" class="tag">Funding Approach & Process</a> <a href="/themes/trust-power" class="tag">Trust & Power</a></div><div class="quotes"><h3>Quotes</h3><q cite=""><p>“The ILs are simply the best out there.”</p></q> <q cite=""><p>“I can feel our IL wants us to succeed.”</p></q> <q cite=""><p>“Our IL remembers things we told them a year ago.”</p></q> <q cite=""><p>“Our IL is constructive, smart, wise, and diligent.”</p></q> <q cite=""><p>“There was a big values overlap.”</p></q> <q cite=""><p>“Usually we need to explain to funders what our impact is – but not [GCE].
