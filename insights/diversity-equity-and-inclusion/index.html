This is the public report from that research - a collaboration between Luminate, formerly the Governance &amp; Citizen Engagement (GCE) Initiative at Omidyar Network, and Simply Secure. The interviews and survey were conducted over the course of July - September 2018.</p><p><a href="https://ontrustandtransparency.report/project-details">Learn more about the project</a></p></div><div class="column large-12 medium-12 small-12 underline-link underline-link--white"><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/h8kgu1arvxtu/7xku46Av2bRp4URFz3l19j/c5f8e07675ba2785face65e25fef5c11/simsec-logo.svg" alt="Simply Secure Logo"><p>Simply Secure is a US 501(c)3 non-profit building a community of practitioners that puts people at the center of privacy, security, and transparency.

Not doing so can lead organizations to question the funder’s commitment to DEI, and the extent to which DEI informs organizational culture and plays into both funding and internal processes.</p></div><div class="column large-4 medium-12 small-12"><div class="quote-container"><q>“They’re not attuned to equity issues, and sometimes come off as dismissive.”</q></div></div></div></section><section class="page-section description-container"><div class="row"><div class="column large-7 medium-12 small-12 insight-description"><p>Interviewees mentioned in multiple contexts that GCE did not appear to them to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Organizations questioned whether and how DEI played into the funding process and GCE’s internal practices.</p><p>Participants would welcome a more direct and transparent approach to the values of DEI at Luminate. Participants sometimes ascribed frustration with systemic discrimination problems happening in Silicon Valley onto GCE as well, due to their perception that GCE’s approach was aligned with more negative aspects of Silicon Valley’s culture. Some participants even spoke about not bringing up DEI-related issues with GCE, saying that they didn’t think GCE would be able to help or even understand. For these participants, their perception of GCE was of an organization that was heteronormative, white, and male.</p><p>Several participants also found it noteworthy that there was no diversity data on the Omidyar Network / GCE website. They also remarked on the fact that the team did not ask for any diversity data during the investment process.</p><p>Participants were generally aware that GCE used DEI considerations in their assessment of an organization, but it seems that not all ILs involved grantees in the collection or reporting of that information about the organization.</p><p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p><p>Transparency is key to fostering an equitable playing field amongst grantees. Transparency ensures that information about funding processes and support are made clear to all, rather than offered through informal channels only to grantees in a position to initiate a discussion or inquiry.</p></div><div class="column large-4"><div class="themes-quotes-container"><div class="themes"><h3>Themes</h3><a href="/themes/trust-power" class="tag">Trust & Power</a> <a href="/themes/funder-identity-culture" class="tag">Funder Identity & Culture</a></div><div class="quotes"><h3>Quotes</h3><q cite=""><p>“I’m just not sure they’re the right group to help with [our sensitive DEI issue].”</p></q></div></div></div></div></section><section class="divider divider--blue"><div class="row"><div class="column large-12"><h4>Related Recommendations</h4><a class="arrow-forward" href="/recommendations">All Recommendations <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i></a></div></div></section><section class=""><ul class="list list--recommendation"><li class="list__item list__item--recommendation"><a href="/recommendations/be-explicit-about-the-role-dei-plays" class="card card--recommendation"><p>Be <strong>explicit about the role DEI plays in your organization</strong> and how you are integrating DEI-related efforts and considerations into your funding approach, strategies and external relationships.</p></a></li><li class="list__item list__item--recommendation"><a href="/recommendations/diversify-your-network" class="card card--recommendation"><p>Consider finding ways to <strong>diversify your network</strong> and the organizations you fund, by, for example, intentionally engaging with organizations beyond the types of entities and approaches that you are most familiar and comfortable with, and questioning your frame of reference for what is ‘a fit.’</p></a></li><li class="list__item list__item--recommendation"><a href="/recommendations/strategic-priorities" class="card card--recommendation"><p>Be <strong>transparent</strong> about your <strong>strategic priorities</strong>, and keep grantees informed as to how they may be changing.</p></a></li><li class="list__item list__item--recommendation"><a href="/recommendations/clear-collaborative-outputs" class="card card--recommendation"><p>Develop processes that are <strong>transparent</strong> and used <strong>consistently</strong> with all potential grantees, so that everyone has the <strong>same opportunities to engage on the design</strong> of their grant and related outcomes (e.g., metrics, reporting, grant structure).</p></a></li><li class="list__item list__item--recommendation"><a href="/recommendations/clarify-the-funding-process" class="card card--recommendation"><p>Clarify the steps, inputs and outputs of the <strong>funding process</strong>, and the process for accessing alternative types of support.
